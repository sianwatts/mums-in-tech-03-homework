              <p>
                We have now covered <strong>HTML</strong>, including: what it is; how to write it and why
                it's important to try and keep the semantic meaning of our HTML whilst separating the visual
                information and design.

              <h4 class="topic-title">The Terminal</h4>
              <p>
                With a harrowing journey through the beggining of the terminal, we have covered how to
                navigate directories using <code>cd</code> to change directories, <code>ls</code> to
                list directory contents and have started to feel more confidant when faced with a terminal
                window.

            <li class="topic">
              <h4 class="topic-title">Version control with Git</h4>
              <p>
                The introduction to Git covered why it is used <em>(tracking changes)</em> as well as the impact it
                can have when working in a team (<em>branches, merging, pushing and pulling</em>). Some have
                been able to progress to actually publishing their own code onto <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
                which is a fantastic milestone!

              <h4 class="topic-title">Styling with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></h4>
              <p>
                The way a HTML page looks is powered primarily by the <strong>CSS</strong> used. There are a huge number
                of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS properties</a> and many
                small differences between web browsers. These are things that are learn over time, the important thing to
                do is try. Search, checkout examples even inspect other sites to see how they have done it.
